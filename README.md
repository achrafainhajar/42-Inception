# HOW DOCKER WORK
Docker is a tool that lets you put your entire app and all its needed stuff (like libraries and settings) into a container.
This container can run on any computer that has Docker, and it'll work the same way everywhere.
# HOW DOCKER COMPOSE WORK
Docker Compose is a tool that makes it easy to manage and run multiple containers that work together as a single application. It uses a simple configuration file to describe how these containers should be set up and connected. With Docker Compose, you can start, stop, and manage all these containers with just a few simple commands.
# DIFF BETWEEN DOCKER IMAGE WITH DOCKER COMPOSE AND WITHOUT IT
Using a Docker image without Docker Compose is like using a single tool to build something on your own, step by step. and with it is like having a toolkit that lets you build a whole project with many tools all at once, following a predefined plan.
# THE BENEFIT OF DOCKER COMPARED TO VM
usage of less memory, faster ,docker images works in different env
# Docker Network
Docker network is a way to let the containers talks to each other to share information.
